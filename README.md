## Introduction

LeetCode is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews and enhancing problem-solving skills with coding challenges. This repository is my personal collection of solutions to problems I've solved on LeetCode.

## Solution Structure

Each solution is stored in a separate directory named after the problem title. Within each directory, you'll find:

- A Python file containing the solution code (e.g., `solution.py`)
- A markdown file with a detailed explanation of the solution (e.g., `README.md`)
- Any additional files, such as input/output examples or test cases
